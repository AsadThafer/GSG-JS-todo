# GSG-JS-todo
Welcome to the repository for the Gazaskygeeks JavaScript Advanced Training!
This repository contains a todo list application implemented using JavaScript and Node.js.
The application allows users to create, update, and manage their tasks in an organized manner.

- The app includes features such as adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, filtering the list by completed or incomplete tasks, and sorting tasks by the due date or priority.
- Created the Task object with properties : task description, due date, and priority level, using prototypes.
- Managed the list of tasks using arrays and array methods : push(), filter(), and sort().
- When a user adds a new task, create a new Task object and add it to the array.
- When a user marks a task as completed, use filter() to find the task in the array and update its status.
- When a user deletes a task, removed it from the array using splice().
- used (stdin) to read input from the user.
- Print for the user a list of actions that he can do.
